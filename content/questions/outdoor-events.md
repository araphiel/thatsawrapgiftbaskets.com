answer = "We use only the highest quality products and make every possible effort to ensure that your décor will meet or exceed your expectations. However, due to the general nature of balloons, we cannot guarantee that your balloons will remain perfect and intact when used outdoors. Some balloons will occasionally deflate sooner than expected and will also be adversely affected by wind, rain, rough handling, extreme heat and other uncontrollable factors.\n\nIn the event of cancellation without a rain contingency plan, the customer agrees to compensate That’s A Wrap And More with the full payment.\n\n**SUN DAMAGE-** On the off chance that the sun is shining bright enough to cause any damage, it’s worth noting that if left in the sun, the balloon can start to fade. If it’s super hot, then be sure to know the balloon may pop."
