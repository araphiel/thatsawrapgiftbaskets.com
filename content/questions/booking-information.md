answer = "An event is ONLY considered “booked” after payment (50% deposit or full amount) is made by the due date indicated on service invoice. If the client allows quotes/invoice to expire, it is understood that the event date and time will be made available to other clients, and any discount or special promotion applied will be removed and invalid."
description = "The initial payment (50% of the total balance or $150 if the total is unknown) is a **Non-refundable** **retainer fee**, which reserves the event date and time, and is required if the event is scheduled more than seven days prior to the event. **If your event is booked less than one week, you will be required to pay in full at time of booking.** The remaining balance must be paid no later than 2 days prior to the day of your event, delivery or pick-up."
