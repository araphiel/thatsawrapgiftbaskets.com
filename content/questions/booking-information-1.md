answer = "An event is ONLY considered “booked” after payment (50% deposit or full amount) is made by the due date indicated on service invoice. If the client allows quotes/invoice to expire, it is understood that the event date and time will be made available to other clients, and any discount or special promotion applied will be removed and invalid."
