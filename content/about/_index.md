That's A Wrap And More was established in January 2019 by Brittney Collins, founder & owner.

Living in the Euless, Texas; I am able to share my gift with all of DFW.

I truly love working with my clients to make their dream & vision a reality. And remember any basket, event, or party will be made with love and you in mind. We are sure to impress for any of the holidays.
